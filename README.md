## Design Patterns:
  ### Singleton 
    - Ensures the Root tree only has one instance with a private constructor (Demonstrated in Root.java) 
  ### Composite
    - General User is the interface component with User being a leaf and UserGroup being a composite. 
  ### Observer
    - Follower logic. Follwers were observers, and would be notified of new changes to update their newsfeed. 
  ### Visitor
    - Implemented to help 'visit' users and usergroups for statistics

**All done using Java with UI in JavaFX and FXML**
